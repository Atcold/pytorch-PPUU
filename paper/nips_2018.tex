\section{Introduction}

The contributions of this work are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item We introduce a new open-source environment to test methods for autonomous driving, based on a large dataset of real-world driving data.
\item We introduce a novel method for prediction under uncertainty which is simple to train, does not make assumptions about a prior distribution over latent variables or require sampling at training time, and is able to generate diverse predictions for hundreds of timesteps into the future.
\end{itemize}


\section{Prediction Model}

Most methods for stochastic prediction rely on the framework of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs).
VAEs assume a prior over latent variables and include a loss term measuring the KL divergence between this prior and the distribution output by the posterior network.
This helps ensure that latent variables sampled from this prior at generation time are consistent with those input to the decoder network during training.
Simple priors such as diagonal Gaussians are common choices, as they enable a closed-form expression for the KL divergence between prior and posterior distributions, which in turn reduces the variance of the gradients with respect to this term.
A widely recognized issue with VAEs is the so-called ``posterior collapse'' or ``over-regularization'' problem, which is caused by a conflict between the prior matching term and the reconstruction term in the loss function. If the regularization term is too high, this can cause the model to ignore the latent variables altogether in order to avoid a high cost due to the KL term. If the regularization term is too low, this can cause the model to learn a latent variable distribution which does not match with the assumed prior, leading to poor generations at test time.

We propose an alternate approach which does not place any priors on the latent variable distribution and instead relies on a non-parametric or semi-parametric sampling procedure to produce new generations at test time.
By removing the prior assumption, we also do away with the need for a regularization term at training time which enforces a match between prior and posterior distributions, leading to a simple and easy to optimize loss. After training, we obtain a non-parametric estimate of the distribution over latent variables by extracting a collection of latent variables from the training set itself, which we then combine with new inputs to obtain generations.
Through this non-parametric sampling procedure, we naturally obtain samples which are on the manifold of latent variables.
If the prior distribution over latent variables is dependent on the input, it may additionally be necessary to restrict our sampling to a limited region of the manifold.
We therefore propose and empirically investigate two ways of achieving this: one through a smoothness assumption on the trajectories of latent variables along the manifold, which translates into a nearest-neighbor based sampling scheme, and by combining the non-parametric sampling scheme with a parametric likelihood model which restricts our sampling to a subregion of the manifold.


Our stochastic prediction model can be viewed as a conditional autoencoder paired with a non-parametric  or semi-parametric sampling procedure.
The architecture consists of three neural networks: an encoder $f_1$, a decoder $f_2$ and a latent variable network $\phi$.
For each sample, the update equations are given by:

\begin{align*}
z_i &= \phi(x_i, y_i) \\
\tilde{y}_i &= f_2(f_1(x_i), z_i)
\end{align*}

and all networks are trained by gradient descent to optimize the following objective:

\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L} &= \sum_i \|y_i - \tilde{y_i} \|_2^2 \\
  &= \sum_i \|y_i - f(x_i, \phi(x_i, y_i)) \|_2^2
\end{align}

Note in particular that no sampling or reparamaterization is done at training time.
In standard autoencoders, some mechanism is used to limit the information content of the latent representation to avoid learning trivial mappings and thus encourage the model to learn good representations.
In the conditional case we are considering, we also need such a mechanism to prevent the network from simply reconstructing $y_i$ while ignoring the input $x_i$.
In our experiments we found setting the dimension of $z_i$ to be of much lower dimension than $y_i$ to work well, however other methods such as adding a sparsity or contractive penalty term could also be used.
After training, we extract all vectors $z_i$ from the training set and use these as inputs to new inputs.

\section{Related Work}

In recent years, several works have explored prediction of complex time series such as video \citep{mathieu-iclr-2016}.
These typically train models to predict future frames with the goal of learning good representations which disentangle factor of variation and can be used for unsupervised learning \citep{Srivastava15, Villegas17, DentonB17} or learn action-conditional forward models which can be used for planning \citep{Oh15, FinnGL16, Poke, VideoPixel}.
Several works have included latent variables as a means to model the uncertainty, using the framework of Variational Autoencoders \citep{Babaeizadeh2018, Denton2018}.
In contrast to VAEs, our model does not place any priors on the latent variable distribution, which removes the need for an additional loss term enforcing consistency between the prior and posterior.
Additionally, our approach does not require any sampling at training time which reduces the variance in the gradients.

Our method is closely related to Gated and Relational Autoencoders \citep{RelationalAE, GAE}, which were used to learn transformations between pairs of images in an unsupervised manner.
The general architecture and loss is similar in both our works, however their focus was on representation learning for static images while ours is on video generation for use in planning.

\end{itemize}


\section{Data sets}
We trained our latent variable forward model on a synthetic data set first --- where we are in partial control of the stochasticity of the data --- and on real vehicle trajectories afterwards.

\section{Experiments}


We evaluate our prediction model using two quantitative metrics in addition to visual evaluation.
\begin{itemize}
\item We follow the protocol used in previous works on stochastic generation \citep{Walker2016, Babaeizadeh2018, Denton2018}, where we generate a fixed number of samples using the stochastic model, compare each sample to the ground truth sample in the test set, and report the error of the best match.
  This method provides some measure of how well the stochastic model covers the space of possible futures, although it does not necessarily reflect the realism of all the generated samples.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{A note on evaluation}

We provide a discussion of evaluation metrics, and their relationship to the stochasticity of the prediction task.
Here we argue that the metric used in previous work \citep{Walker2016, Babaeizadeh2018, Denton2018} is only meaningful when the number of samples generated is of similar magnitude to the number of possible futures.
Consider the task of modeling a distribution of one-hot vectors, where each sample is a binary vector with all zeros except for a single $1$, whose index is chosen uniformly between $1$ and $n$.
A baseline model which always predicts the average $\tilde{y} = (1/n, 1/n, ..., 1/n)$ (which is clearly not a valid sample in the target distribution) will have an expected loss of $\sqrt{(n-1)/n}$. A stochastic model which exactly captures the true distribution will have an expected loss of $\sqrt{2} \cdot F(k, k, (n-1)/n)$, where $F$ refers to the cumulative distribution function of a Binomial random variable with $p=(n-1)/n$ (proofs can be found in the Appendix).
Curves of both of these loss functions for different $n$ are shown in Figure \ref{expected-loss}.
These illustrate that as $n$ becomes large, an increasingly high number of samples is required for the correct stochastic prediction model to outperform the deterministic baseline according to this metric.

The number of possible futures of a stochastic process can grow exponentially with the number of time steps.
We therefore use this metric to evaluate model predictions over a limited time horizon in order to give models a chance to capture the true future with a number of samples which is computationally tractable.
Since we are also interested in the the performance of models to generate predictions over long time horizons, we also provide a complementary measure where we train an separate model to distinguish between real and generated images after the stochastic model has been trained. This has been used in several works to evaluate GANs \citep{Danihelka17, Rosca17, GANeval}, however the approach is applicable to generative models more broadly. In this work we use the Least-Squares GAN Criterion \citep{Mao16}, as this was found to be both stable and sensitive in \citep{GANeval}.

\section{Appendix}


\subsection{Proof of Expected Loss}

The baseline model always produces the same prediction $\tilde{y} = (\frac{1}{n}, ..., \frac{1}{n})$. Each sample from the true distribution is of the form $y_i = (0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0)$ with a single non-zero element.
\begin{align*}
  \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}_{\mbox{baseline}}] &= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (\tilde{y}_i - y_i)^2} \\
  &= \sqrt{(1-\frac{1}{n})^2 + (n-1)\Big ( \frac{1}{n} \Big )^2} \\
  &= \sqrt{\frac{(n-1)^2 + (n-1)}{n^2}} \\
  &= \sqrt{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\end{align*}

To compute the best-of-$k$ loss, the true stochastic model produces $k$ samples of the same form as the one drawn from the true distribution, i.e. $\tilde{y}_k = (0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0)$, where the non-zero index is chosen uniformly from $1$ to $n$.
Let $j$ denote the non-zero index of the sample drawn from the true distribution and $i_1, i_2, ..., i_k$ non-zero indices of the samples output by the stochastic model.
The probability of each sample \textit{not} matching $y_j$ is equal to $p=\frac{n-1}{n}$.
Therefore, the probability of none of the generated samples matching $y_j$ is equal to the cumulative distribution function of a binomial random variable $B(k, p)$, denoted $F(k, k, p)$.
In the case of a generated sample matching $y_j$, the best-of-$k$ loss will equal 0, otherwise it will equal $\sqrt{2}$.

Putting this together, the expected best-of-$k$ loss is given by:

\begin{align*}
  \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}_{\mbox{best-of-$k$}}] &= \mbox{P(at least one sample matches)}\cdot 0 + \mbox{P(none of the samples match)} \cdot \sqrt{2} \\
  &= \sqrt{2} \cdot F\Big (k, k, \frac{n-1}{n} \Big) \\
\end{align*}

\subsection{Relationship to VAEs}

Our model can also be viewed through the lens of Variational Autoencoders, as a type of conditional VAE with a zero-variance posterior network and a uniform categorical prior.
In this case, the KL term reduces to a constant which can be ignored during training; details can be found in the Appendix.
%\begin{equation}
%\mathcal{L} = \|y_i - f(x_i, \phi(x_i, y_i)) \|_2^2 + \beta \cdot \mbox{KL}(p_\phi(z | x_i) || p_\psi(z | x_i, y_i))
%\end{equation}

\textbf{Fixed Prior}

\begin{align}
  &p_\psi(z_j | x_i, y_i) =
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \mbox{ if } i = j \\
    0 & \mbox{ else } \\
  \end{cases} \\
  &p_\phi(z_j | x_i) = \frac{1}{M}
  \\
\end{align}

The KL divergence is therefore:

\begin{align}
\mbox{KL}(p_\phi(z | x_i) || p_\psi(z | x_i, y_i)) &= \sum_j p_\psi(z_j | x_i, y_i) \log \frac{p_\psi(z_j | x_i, y_i)}{p_\phi(z_j | x_i)} \\
&= 1 \cdot \log \frac{1}{\frac{1}{M}} \\
&= \log M
\end{align}

\textbf{Learned Prior}

\begin{align}
  &p_\psi(z_j | x_i, y_i) =
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \mbox{ if } i = j \\
    0 & \mbox{ else } \\
  \end{cases} \\
  &p_\phi(z_j | x_i) = \frac{h(z_j; x_j, \theta)}{\sum_{k=1}^M h(z_k; x_j, \theta)}
\end{align}

The KL divergence is therefore:

\begin{align}
\mbox{KL}(p_\phi(z | x_i) || p_\psi(z | x_i, y_i)) &= \sum_j p_\psi(z_j | x_i, y_i) \log \frac{p_\psi(z_j | x_i, y_i)}{p_\phi(z_j | x_i)} \\
&= 1 \cdot \log \frac{1}{\frac{h(z_j; x_j, \theta)}{\sum_{k=1}^M h(z_k; x_j, \theta)}} \\
&= - \log \frac{h(z_j; x_j, \theta)}{\sum_{k=1}^M h(z_k; x_j, \theta)} \\
&= - \log h(z_j; x_j, \theta) + \log \sum_{k=1}^M h(z_k; x_j, \theta)
\end{align}

The last term is a constant and can be ignored.
